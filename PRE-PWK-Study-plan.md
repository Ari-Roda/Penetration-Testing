# Study Plan
Ideally I would use the PWK study materials and labs to prepare for OSCP but to save money by getting less lab access or just dedicating the most time possible to the labs considerable study can be done on non PWK sources. Taken from various various blogs within the OSCP-Resources file under blogs.


1. Read course Syllabus to get used to outcomes required.

2. Go through Syllabus and outline tools, techniques and procedures that can be used for each. (Use existing notes that do this https://guide.offsecnewbie.com/general-methodology, https://refabr1k.gitbook.io/oscp/, https://sushant747.gitbooks.io/total-oscp-guide/content/, aswell as tutorials and Tryhackme)

3. Do the Local Privilege Escalation workshop (https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop) THM Windows priv esc. This might not be fun but youâ€™ll learn a lot.
Also check g0tmi1k linux privilege escalation guide (https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) and THM linux priv esc.

4. Find VM's, labs to practice these until confident.

4. Go through VM's from various platforms which are similar to OSCP machines. (https://i.redd.it/ha32rd930hg51.png). Tryhackme, HacktheBox etc.

5. Review youtube Walkthroughs especially IPPSec's OSCP playlist.

6. Periodically review Syllabus to revisit topics and retrain on weaknesses.
