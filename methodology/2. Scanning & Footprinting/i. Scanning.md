Initial scanning can be done with scanning programs such as nmap or masscan. This can be done in steps such as doing multiple scans of different complexity to allow for faster analysis if your time restricted. For example, queue up ping scan, port scan and service scan. This can also be done in one go which may take time to finish. Tools like autorecon can be used which do many scans of different complexity on an IP or group of IP's.
