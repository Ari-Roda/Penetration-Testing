1. Before Scanning check your connected to and have access to the networks you should have access to. Check your routing table to identify you have access to the networks you should. someimtes you will know what networks you should be able to access other types you wont but its better to confirm you can access a network before beginning scanning since if your scanning multiple subnets and the results return nothing for particular subnet because you dont have access but there is actually important targets there this is a problem.
