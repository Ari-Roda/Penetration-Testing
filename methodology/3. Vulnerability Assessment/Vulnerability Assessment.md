Once you have identified the particular services and their versions within the target infrastructure we can begin assessing their pheasability. Googling the particular service and version and looking for cve entries on them is a good start. Similarly Searchsploit/exploit db can be used to find vulnerabilities along with possible exploit code. Note PoC/exploitcode code can be found by googling github and other repositories also.
