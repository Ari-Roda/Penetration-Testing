Once you have identified the particular services and their versions within the target infrastructure we can begin assessing their pheasability. Googling the particular service and version and looking for cve entries on them is a good start. Similarly Searchsploit/exploit db can be used to find vulnerabilities along with possible exploit code. Note PoC/exploitcode code can be found by googling github and other repositories also. 

vulnerability assessments can be done on their own and stop at the assessment part and not go through to exploitation. but this doesnt confirm that the vulnerabilites are actually exploitable and doesnt allow to find  new vulnerabilities that are connected to exploitable machines.
