Execute uname -a to print out all information about the system.
This simple box enumeration allows you to get initial information about the box, such as distro type and version. From this point you can easily look for known exploits and vulnerabilities. And also give you information to create an msfvenom reverse shell.

> Next in our list are auto-generated bash files.
Bash keeps tracks of our actions by putting plaintext used commands into a history file. (~/.bash_history)
If you happen to have a reading permission on this file, you can easily enumerate system user's action and retrieve some sensitive infrmation. One of those would be plaintext passwords or privilege escalation methods. 

.bash_profile and .bashrc are files containing shell commands that are run when Bash is invoked. These files can contain some interesting start up setting that can potentially reveal us some infromation. For example a bash alias can be pointed towards an important file or process.

> Next thing that you want to check is the sudo version.
Sudo command is one of the most common targets in the privilage escalation. Its version can help you identify known exploits and vulnerabilities. Execute sudo -V to retrieve the version.
For example, sudo versions < 1.8.28 are vulnerable to CVE-2019-14287, which is a vulnerability that allows to gain root access with 1 simple command. 

> Last part of basic enumeration comes down to using our sudo rights.
Users can be assigned to use sudo via /etc/sudoers file. It's a fully customazible file that can either limit or open access to a wider range of permissions. Run sudo -l to check if a user on the box is allowed to use sudo with any command on the system.
