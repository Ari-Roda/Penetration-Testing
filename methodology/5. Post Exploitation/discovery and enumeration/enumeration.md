Execute uname -a to print out all information about the system.
This simple box enumeration allows you to get initial information about the box, such as distro type and version. From this point you can easily look for known exploits and vulnerabilities. And also give you information to create an msfvenom reverse shell.

> Next in our list are auto-generated bash files.
Bash keeps tracks of our actions by putting plaintext used commands into a history file. (~/.bash_history)
If you happen to have a reading permission on this file, you can easily enumerate system user's action and retrieve some sensitive infrmation. One of those would be plaintext passwords or privilege escalation methods. 

.bash_profile and .bashrc are files containing shell commands that are run when Bash is invoked. These files can contain some interesting start up setting that can potentially reveal us some infromation. For example a bash alias can be pointed towards an important file or process.

> Next thing that you want to check is the sudo version.
Sudo command is one of the most common targets in the privilage escalation. Its version can help you identify known exploits and vulnerabilities. Execute sudo -V to retrieve the version.
For example, sudo versions < 1.8.28 are vulnerable to CVE-2019-14287, which is a vulnerability that allows to gain root access with 1 simple command. 

> Last part of basic enumeration comes down to using our sudo rights.
Users can be assigned to use sudo via /etc/sudoers file. It's a fully customazible file that can either limit or open access to a wider range of permissions. Run sudo -l to check if a user on the box is allowed to use sudo with any command on the system. 


> /etc/passwd
This file stores the most essential information, required during the user login process. (It stores user account information). It's a plain-text file that contains a list of the system's accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, and more.

How can this help? Well, if you have at least reading access to this file, you can easily enumerate all existing users, services and other accounts on the system. This can open a lot of vectors for you and lead to the desired root. 

Otherwise, if you have writing access to the /etc/passwd, you can easily get root creating a custom entry with root priveleges.

> /etc/shadow
The /etc/shadow file stores actual password in an encrypted format (aka hashes) for userâ€™s account with additional properties related to user password. Those encrypted passwords usually have a pretty similar structure, making it easy for us to identify the encoding format and crack the hash to get the password.

So, as you might have guessed, we can use /etc/shadow to retrieve different user passwords. In most of the situations, it is more than enough to have reading permissions on this file to escalate to root privileges. 

Just like with /etc/passwd, writeable permission can allow us to add a new root user by making a custom entry.


> /etc/hosts
/etc/hosts is a simple text file that allows users to assign a hostname to a specific IP address. Generally speaking, a hostname is a name that is assigned to a certain device on a network. It helps to distinguish one device from another. The hostname for a computer on a home network may be anything the user wants, for example, DesktopPC or MyLaptop. 

You can try editing your own /etc/hosts file by adding the 10.10.229.207 there like so:

From now on you'll be able to refer to the box as box.thm.

Why do we need it? In real-world pentesting this file may reveal a local address of devices in the same network. It can help us to enumerate the network further.
