Netcat shells can unexpectedly close or crash quickly making us lose access to the target. Therefore after achieving exploitation and before getting persistenc it is beneficial to upgrade and stabilize your shell. This allos for commands like su and sudo to be used which previously werent possible.
The simplest way to upgrade to tty (text terminal) shell is iwth python one liner to run bash in python.

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'


GTFO bins can be used to find ways to get tty shell and this link has more methods to achieve this. blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys

Generally speaking, you want to use an external tool to execute /bin/bash for you. While doing so, it is a good idea to try everything you know, starting from python, finishing with getting a binary on the target system.
