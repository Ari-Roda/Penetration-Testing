1. Initial Reconaisonce begins by understanding engagement requirements deeply. There can be lots of crucial information within the engagement document.

2. Check open sources on target.

  2a. Checking targets actual website.
      2aa. Chicking Organization structure, board of directors profiles, executive profiles, products, job vacancies, partners, suppliers, employees from blog.
  2b. Check social media of target.
      2ba. Find target company employees  
            -Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Google+ etc (social network can depend on target compnies industry and interest eg. if target company is in media or advertisement Instagram might be best. Also specific niche social networks/forums and messageboards for targets industry can be useful)
            - Some SNS sites allow for account linking, eg Twitter to Facebook etc. Can leverage this to find more information on target. Linkedin Forces users to use real name so if can find connection to linkedin account, from twitter or other SNS can get good PII.

3. Whois database and other sites can be used to find further detailed information. 

4. Find example emails and try to determine the email schema they might use internally. You may get this from the site itself, Social media like linkedin or other site, or you might have to email someone internally and check their email. If none of these work you can try to guess the email schema using common ones such as name.surname@company.com, surname.name@company.com, first letter of namesurname@company.com. You can then send to employees found through SNS in this format, if the email doesnt exist you should get a email in return saying so but not always. The email you send shouldnt be suspicious and alert anyone, so make it look like spam possibly. Check the emails that didnt get sent to know the correct email schema.

5.Find as many websites owned by the company as possible. Enumerating the main domain may find various subdomains available that contain valuable information. At this stage passive enumeration should be used meaning we do not directly interact with the target. Instead we can use google and other online resources to search for available domains owned by the company. In Google you can use site: company.com to search based on particular domain. Also dnsdumpster.com indexes search sites for information. Sublist3r collects DNS data from various sources
