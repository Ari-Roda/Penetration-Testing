<mark>Staging/Stager</mark> : The stager is responsible for downloading a large payload (the stage), injecting it into memory, and passing execution to it. Essentially sending stager to machine which can then download files from a malicious server in stages to bypass size restrictions, AV and is more flexible since can be used to download various types of malware. Staging first came about out of necessity. Many exploitable situations constrain how many bytes an attacker may load, unchanged, into one contiguous location in memory. One way to do interesting post exploitation in these situations is to deliver the payload in stages. Staging makes it possible to deliver a variety of payloads with just a few stagers. So long as I have code that is compatible with a stager, I may deliver my code with all the exploits the stager supports (again, size is a constraint).

Downloader : A "downloader" downloads a second stage (usually some kind of malware) which requires a network connection.

Dropper : A dropper means the malware drops something on the system that wasn't there before (like an executable). Often this is embedded in the original file but could also be downloaded.
